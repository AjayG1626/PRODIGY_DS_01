#Visualizing the Distribution of a Variable
This project includes a script to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable using a bar chart or histogram. Visualizing data distributions is crucial for understanding the underlying patterns and characteristics of the dataset, which can inform further analysis and decision-making processes. Below are the key points and a brief description related to this task.

#Key Points:
Dataset Preparation: Ensure the dataset is clean and properly formatted for analysis. This may include handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring the data is in the correct type (categorical or continuous).

#Choosing the Right Visualization:
Bar Chart: Suitable for categorical variables to show the frequency or count of each category.
Histogram: Suitable for continuous variables to show the distribution of data points across different ranges.
Customization: Customize the chart with titles, labels, colors, and legends to make it informative and visually appealing.
Tools and Libraries: Utilize popular data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly in Python to create the charts.
